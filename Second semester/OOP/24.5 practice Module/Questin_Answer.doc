1. What is CAP Theorem?
    Answer: CAP full meaning (Consistency Availability Partition Tolerance)
    The CAP Theorem is comprised of three components (hence its name)
    as they relate to distributed date stores:
    1.Consistency: All reads receive the most recent write or an error
    2.Availability: All reads contain data, but it might not be the most recent
    3.The system continues to operate despite network failures(ie; dropped partitions, slow network 
    connections, or unavailable network connections between nodes.)
