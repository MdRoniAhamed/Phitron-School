Lab Exam 5 week  .


Question  no 1:	

Write a function that takes as input a number and outputs its square.

Answer :
#include<stdio.h>
int  square(int a)///Write a Function .
{   int v=0;
    v= a*a;
    return v;
}
int main(   )
{ 
    int a;
    scanf("%d",&a);/// Input a Number.

     int v=  square(a);

    printf("Square %d",v);///Output Square.
    return 0;
}


Question  no 2:	

How do you declare a function that takes as input an integer and a double and returns a char?

Answer :

Question  no 3:
	
Suppose you have a function gcd(a, b) that finds the gcd of two numbers. Write a program that
takes as input 10 integers and finds their gcd. You can assume that the gcd function is implemented.

Answer :
#include<stdio.h>
 int gcd(int a, int b)
 {
     while(a!=0){
     int x=b%a;
     b=a;
     a=x;
     }
     return b;
 }
 int main(){
    int a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j;
    scanf("%d%d%d%d%d%d%d%d%d%d",&a,&b,&c,&d,&e,&f,&g,&h,&i,&j);
//MD Roni Ahamed

  int A=gcd(a,b);
  int B=gcd(A,c);
  int C=gcd(B,d);
  int D=gcd(C,e);
  int E=gcd(D,f);
  int F=gcd(E,g);
  int G=gcd(F,h);
  int H=gcd(G,i);
  int I=gcd(H,j);
 // int J=gcd(I,c);
  printf("%d",I);

 return 0;
 }


Question  no 4:	

void makeSum(int a, int b, int *sum)

Implement the function.

Answer :

Question  no 5:

Answer :

Question  no 6:

void makeNArray(int n, int *sum) populates sum with first n square numbers. Implement the function.

Answer :

Question  no 7:

How can you use the return by address mechanism to return two integers from a function? Explain with an example.

Answer :

Question  no 8:

strcat(char a[], char b[], char []out) The strcat function takes two strings and contacts them and outputs them to a out. 
Assume that out has enough space to hold contents of both a and b. Implement the function.

Answer :

Question  no 9:

Write a program using pointers to read in an array of integers and Print its elements in reverse order.

Answer :

Question  no 10:
